title: "Minimalism To Free My Mind and Life"
---

To aid me on my journey, I've taken to minimalism and my goal is to implement it in several aspects and dimensions of my life. These include,

* material possessions (clothes, accessories, watches, pens, shoes, etc.)
* relationships - retain, nurture, and maintain a few meaningful relationships. 
* speech and thought: the hardest of them all - speak less, do more, and think more about little. 
* spiritual: don't try everything under the Sun - concentrate on japa and rAma nAma.

Thank you.

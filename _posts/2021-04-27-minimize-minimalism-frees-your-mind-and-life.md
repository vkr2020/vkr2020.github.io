title: "Minimalism To Free My Mind and Life"
---

To aid me on my journey, I've taken to minimalism and my goal is to implement it in several aspects and dimensions of my life. These include,

* **material possessions:** clothes, accessories, watches, pens, shoes, etc.
* **relationships:**  retain, nurture, and maintain a few meaningful relationships. 
* **speech and thought:** the hardest of them all - speak less, do more, and think more about little. 
* **spiritual:** don't try everything under the Sun - concentrate on japa and rAma nAma.
* **business:** don't take up every random project, and simply focus on one.

It feels odd packing up everything that I have carefully or carelessly bought over the past few years and forgetting about it. But, I think that is the point. If I don't use something for a year, then do I really need it? This is probably not meant to be a blanket statement, but, I think it explains what I am aiming at.

**Identifying and taking care of what matters and makes an impact on my day-to-day life, my relations, and my sAdhana.** 

Thank you.

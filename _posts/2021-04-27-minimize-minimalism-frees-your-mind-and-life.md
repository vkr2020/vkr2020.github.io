To aid me on my journey, I've taken to **minimalism** and my goal is to implement it in several aspects and dimensions of my life, over the course of this year.

These include,

* **material possessions:** cutting down on the number of clothes, accessories, watches, pens, shoes, etc. that I own.
* **relationships:**  retain, nurture, and maintain a few meaningful relationships. 
* **speech and thought:** the hardest of them all - speak less, do more, and think more about little. 
* **spiritual:** don't try everything under the Sun - concentrate on japa and rAma nAma.
* **business:** don't take up every random project, and simply focus on one.

It feels odd packing up everything that I have carefully or carelessly bought over the past few years and forgetting about it. But, I think that is the point. If I don't use something for a year, then do I really need it? This is probably not meant to be a blanket statement, but, I think it explains what I am aiming at.

**Identifying and taking care of what matters and makes an impact on my day-to-day life, my relations, and my sAdhana.** 

Also, minimizing my possessions has also given me a glimpse into my monkey-brain and has shown me how I've reacted to certain situations in the past that have led to some of my possessions. 

On another positive note, ruthlessly cutting down on my possessions has led to a lot of donations. Great!

Thank you.

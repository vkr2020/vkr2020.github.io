**bhajo re bhaiyya, rAm govinda hare** is a very popular bhajan written by [Sant Kabir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabir), a 15th-century Indian mystic poet and saint who was one of the spearheads of the bhakti movement. 

The meaning conveyed by this bhajan is so sweet and straightforward. All Kabir does is to tell you to sing the name of the Lord (rAma). He says that it is so easy to sing the Lord's name - doesn't need any complex yagna, japa sAdhana, rituals, etc. 

All that's needed to gain the blessings and vision of the Lord is sing his sweet name. 

Only an avadhootha can convey such a deep meaning in such few words, so sweetly. 

**Here are the lyrics** 

bhajo re bhaiya  
rAm govind hari  
  
jap tap sAdhana  
kacchu nahi lAgat  
karchat nahi ghaTari  
  
santat sampat  
sukh ke kaaraN  
jAse bhool pari  
  
kahat kabIra   
jA mukh rAm nahi  
woh mukh dhool pari 

**Meaning**

I heard this today and it impacted me deeply. A silk worm spins a cocoon around itself thinking that it is safe and secure, but, little does it know that this very cocoon is going to be the cause of its death. It doesn't know that because of this silk cocoon, some guy is going to dip it in hot water, kill it, and use its silk to weave clothes for himself. 

Our lives are just like this. 

We spin pretty lives around ourselves with fancy clothes, education, friends, accessories, houses, cars, shoes, jobs, co-workers, and live in a fancy world where we think that everything is safe and secure .. because we built a safety net around ourselves, right?

What we fail to see is the fraility of the entire situation. One minute virus has taken down the entire world. An earthquake, a tsunami, or a flood can wipe out entire cities. Where is this security at that point in time?

I am not trying to sound pessimistic or saying that human pursuits towards tech/money/lifestyle are useless, but, what I am trying to say is that there is a deeper purpose at stake here. 

Look at the deaths around you - what came to their rescue? The rich and the poor are dying alike? Why? Why is a healthy person dead the next minute? After a person dies, why is he referred to as a "body"? What happened to the person? Who is the person, then?

We are all busy building a cocoon around ourselves, without stopping to think which hand is going to pick us up and dunk us and our false sense of security in a pot of boiling water. 

If this is true, then what should we be building instead of a cocoon? What?

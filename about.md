This is my spiritual diary where I chronicle my daily meditations, thoughts, practices, and progress. I hope to reach the end of this spiritual journey in this life itself and arrive at a path that heopfully, others can use to remove themselves from this life of misery, greed, and endless pleasure-seeking cycles.

I will explore paths as they appear on my journey with an open mind (as open as I can possible afford) and talk about that as well.

This might appear as a one-way street, but, I can't afford to waver at this juncture.

Thank you.
